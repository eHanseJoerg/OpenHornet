# Mods Folder

All parts inside the "mods" folder are modifications of the original OpenHornet parts. All parts inside this folder do not belong to the OpenHornet release baseline and are therefore not officially supported by the OpenHornet team.

## Documentation
All modifications made to the parts inside the "mods" folder are documented in the `README.md` file inside every folder.
