1:  JLCPCB.com is now using part:  TCA9554PWR as a drop-in replacement for PCA9554PWR.  However, TCA9554PWR is often low in stock in order to purchase both DDI and AMPCD PCBs.
PCA9554 can be used a part alternative but you must ensure you specify PCA9554PWR so the correct package is used if you choose to do this.  

2:  When in doubt, use TCA9554PWR.
